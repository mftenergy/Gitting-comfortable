# Git: Merges / rebasing

<v-switch>
<template #1>
A Pull-Request is the process of raising awareness about a merge from a branch to a target branch, such as a feature branch to main. <br>
The Pull-Request facilitates things like discussions, change requests to edits, diff views, approvals etc - more on this later.

But most importantly it facilitates what happens when a Pull-Request is completed
