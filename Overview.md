# Overview of the Git Kata Exercises

## Setup

1. [configure-git](configure-git/README.md) - If git is not configured, some basic configuration steps

## Basic Git Katas in Suggested Order

1. [basic-commits](basic-commits/README.md) - Very basic creation of commits.
2. [basic-staging](basic-staging/README.md) - Interacting with the stage (index).
3. [basic-branching](basic-branching/README.md) - The first stride into branching.
4. [rebase-branch](rebase-branch/README.md) - Using rebase as an alternative to merging.
5. [basic-revert](basic-revert/README.md) - Use revert to revert a change
6. [reset](reset/README.md) - Reset is a powerful and slightly dangerous command if you do not know what you are doing. Go through the three modes of resetting here.
7. [basic-stashing](basic-stashing/README.md) - The first stride into stashing.

## Katas that solve standard problems

1. [commit-on-wrong-branch](commit-on-wrong-branch/README.md) - If we accidentally put unpushed commits on the wrong branch, how do we effectively _move_ them to another branch before our work on that branch.
2. [commit-on-wrong-branch-2](commit-on-wrong-branch-2/README.md) - Another exercise on what to do if you have accidentally committed on the wrong branch.
3. [detached-head](detached-head/README.md) - git complains that you are in a "You are in 'detached HEAD' state". What do you do?
